# 🎮 Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Python-based number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the player has to guess it. The game continues until the correct number is guessed, and it displays the total number of attempts taken.

## 💡 How It Works
- The game generates a random number using the `random` module.
- The user enters guesses one by one.
- After each incorrect guess, the program gives a message to try again.
- Once the correct number is guessed, the game ends and shows the total number of attempts.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Loops (`while True`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`)
- Random number generation (`random.randint()`)
